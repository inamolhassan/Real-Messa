						<h2>I finally reached 10k</h2>
						<p>I remember thinking, “Heck yes, I did it!”</p>
						<p>I hustled. I put in the work. I did ALL the things.</p>
						<p>And I finally reached my goal of 10k!</p>
						<p>I should have been excited, right?</p>
						<h5>Yes, but not really…</h5>
						<p>I went two months after that without making any money.</p>
						<p>I made ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!</p>
						<p>And deep down I was afraid I wouldn’t be able to repeat my success.</p>
						<p>All that hard work down the drain.</p>
						<h5>Want to know why?</h5>
						<p>Because I had NO IDEA how I made 10k that month.</p>
						<p>I threw some things out in my business… ebooks, webinars, complicated funnels, and somehow it worked!</p>
						<p>But I was tired and burnt out and didn’t want to start the exhausting cycle again.</p>
						<p>A new month meant more hustling and burnout.</p>
						<h5>Something needed to change.</h5>

						</div>
						<div class="paragraphs">
							<p>After realizing this, I shed a lot of weight. I got rid of unnecessary strategies and focused on simple and repeatable systems.</p>
							<h5>And guess what happened?</h5>
							<p>I finally showed up from a place of excitement rather than burnout!</p>
							<p>I streamlined my business and brought in consistent income without adding more to my plate.</p>
							<p>No more going 2 months without making any money!</p>

						<p>Imagine spending billions of dollars on something that you can use only ONCE.</p>
						<p>Would you spend another billion dollars to buy it again? Probably not. I definitely wouldn’t!</p>
						<p>Well, think about your marketing and business as the object you are buying.</p>
						<p>And all the time, effort, and complicated strategies are costing you billions of dollars.</p>
						<p>Would you want to spend billions of dollars each month just to make a few thousand in return? The time and effort needed are not worth it!</p>
						<h5>Wouldn’t it be better to find a simpler and better way to run your business?</h5>
						<p>Similar to how Elon Musk was able to find a way to reuse a rocket instead of paying billions to get a new one each time it launched.</p>
						<p>In the same way– what if you could learn how to streamline your business and make consistent income without all the complicated strategies?</p>
						<p>No more wasting countless hours trying to piece together funnels that only confuse you and your audience.</p>
						<p>It’s time to get rid of strategies that are weighing you down and focus on what’s going to get you to the next level!</p>
						<h5>And this is exactly what I’m going to teach you in AUTHORITY.</h5>

			    <p>However, at this moment you may be uncertain if it’ll work for you. To ease your mind, I am prepared to guarantee your results.</p>

			<h2>One more thing to remember</h2>
			<p><span>The way you REACH a certain goal is VERY different from how you SUSTAIN it.</span></p>
			<p>Yes, you might have reached your dream income goal BUT you’re finding yourself lost and unsure how to hit that goal consistently.</p>
			<p>Honestly, you’d be happy hitting consistent months with ease rather than hustling to make your goal one month and nothing the next month.</p>
			<p><span>Because what really matters to you is FREEDOM.</span></p>
			<p><span>You desire a business that runs itself.</span></p>
			<p>A business where you can step back and it won’t fall apart. A business where you can take a week off and still make money!</p>
			<p>You want a system where your business works without you AND brings in consistent income while only “working” 20 hours a week.</p>
			<p>It’s all about running a business you enjoy and not the other way around.Trust yourself enough to take the first step– everything else will follow!</p>
